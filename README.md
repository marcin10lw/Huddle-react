# Marcin Augun - Huddle landing page

[![](huddle-readme-icon.png)](https://marcin10lw.github.io/Huddle-react/)

## Description

This time I have created Huddle landing page based on one of the numerous challenges of [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/home).

## Live Site URL: [marcin10lw.github.io/Huddle-react](https://marcin10lw.github.io/Huddle-react/)

As always this was an excellent learning opportunity in which I could improve making responsive design and using Font Awesome with Styled Components.

## Challenges

Users should be able to:

 - View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
 - See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
 - See page animations on scroll
